Marketing site redesign

Branching structure for project:
Fork the vigilant/marketing-site master branch into your directory and clone onto your local machine. Create your own gh-pages branch to test your code, i.e. gh-pages branch in thisispayal/marketing-site. When you are satisfied with your changes and have tested it, push them to the vigilant/marketing-site gh-pages branch to test. If the code works in the gh-pages branch, merge changes into the master branch. The master branch will reflect the final copy, the gh-pages will be for testing, and the master branch and gh-pages branch will be identical when everything works.
